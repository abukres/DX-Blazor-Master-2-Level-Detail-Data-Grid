# DXDataGridDemo
A demo for the DevExpress Blazor server side data grid

* [Live Demo](http://siteauditor.net/dxdatagriddemo/MasterDetail)

* This is a self contained demo and it's ready to run except for getting DevExpress' Blazor package. To get it, open an account at DevExpress and go to [nuget.devexpress.com](https://nuget.devexpress.com), log in as a registered DevExpress customer and click **Obtain Feed URL**. Add the feed URL as a nuget source in visual Studio, under Tools -> Options -> Nuget Package Nanager -> Packages Sources and make sure the checkbox is checked. 
Get the nuget command to run from [this link](https://nuget.devexpress.com/packages?q=blazor). Click on the link. Currently the install command is 'Install-Package DevExpress.Blazor -Version 19.1.7'. The version changes as new versions come out. Copy the command and run it the Package Manager Console. This installs a trial version of the DevExpress' Blazor component. I am not sure what happens when it expires. It might stop working or displays some message.
